# sourdough pretzel rolls

## ingredients and supplies

### dough

- 2/3c + 3T warm water
- 1T yeast
- 1c sourdough starter (based on 1:1 water-to-flour ratio)
- 4T olive oil
- 2t sugar
- 2t salt
- 4c + 3T flour

### poaching solution

- 8c to 10c boiling water
- 1/4c baking soda

### glaze and topping

- 1 egg white
- 1T cold water
- pretzel salt to taste

### tools

- stand mixer
- baking sheets
- parchment paper
- large wide pot for poaching
- tongs
- slotted spoon
- brush
- razor blade or sharp knife

## instructions

### dough

- in stand mixer:
  - combine water and yeast
  - let sit for 5 to 10 minutes
  - to the foam add:
    - sourdough starter
    - olive oil
    - sugar
    - salt
    - flour
  - mix until smooth, dough will likely be slightly dry
- cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume (1-2 hours
  typically)

### shaping

- line baking sheets with parchment paper
- divide dough in 18 equal portions
- form each portion into a tight ball by roughly shaping, then pulling
  dough down to the underside of the ball repeatedly
    - the dry surface should form a taught skin
    - make sure the bottom is crimped and sealed with no creases
- cover and let rest ~30 minutes

### poaching

- while resting, boiling water for poaching solution, add to poaching pot
- wait to add the baking soda until you're ready to poach
- before poaching, preheat the oven to 425F (this can take a while)
- poach the rolls
  - put a few rolls (~4) into the solution, right-side up
  - poach bottoms for 30 seconds (this helps seal any remaining creases)
  - using tongs, flip each roll right-side down
  - poach tops for 30 seconds
  - using a slotted spoon, remove each roll and place back on baking sheet

### baking

- prepare the glaze
  - mix egg white and cold water
- brush glaze onto the rolls
  - apply liberally
  - coat the sides, too
- slice a deep `x` into the top of each roll
- sprinkle with pretzel salt to taste
- place baking sheets in center of preheated oven
- bake for 15-20 minutes, until golden brown
- allow to cool

## notes

- the instructions are meant to be followed sequentially
- c: cup, T: tablespoon, t: teaspoon
- block out a bit of time for this
- this recipe is easily doubled, no adjustments necessary, just `*2`
- be prepared to make a mess when poaching
- they will be pretty ugly post-poaching
- you can't really slice too deep
- the order matters - don't slice and _then_ glaze - the glaze will likely
  seal the top shut
- start baking as soon as you slice
