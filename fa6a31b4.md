# replace mode

From Normal mode, `R` activates Replace mode, which behaves a lot like Insert
mode, except that it allows you to effectively type over existing content. This
is different from `r`, which is a single character replacement (ending back in
Normal mode) - `R` requires you to deliberately exit back to Normal mode.
