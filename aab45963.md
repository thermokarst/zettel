# the matrix ecosystem

## matrix protocol

- open spec: decentralised conversation store
- end-to-end encryption
- federated: a lot like email
- you sign up for an acct on a homeserver (could be public, private, etc)
- just like email, that acct can communicate with any other acct, regardless
  of their homeserver
- bridges: glues multiple non-matrix services together: facebook chat, sms, etc


## setting up a homeserver

### https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy

- subdomain config seems to be pretty hard-coded
